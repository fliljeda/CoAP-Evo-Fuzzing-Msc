Degree project experimental suite. Evolutionary fuzzing on coap applications

Suite used for experiments in my master's thesis. Will not (and it was never the intention to) work OOB as it depends on paths and certain binaries. This repository is a complement to the report, where details of the experiments of the experiments are viewable from the original source.
